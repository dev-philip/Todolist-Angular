React vs Angular close differences research by Philip

1. React is a JavaScript library for building UI applications. Angular is a framework for building full fledge applications.
2. To create a new app with Agular you use “ng new appname”
3. In angular we use ng serve or ng the name that is in the script in package.json
4. In anguler we create component with command line using the command “ng g c directory/componentname”. Which will create 4 files for you. For example, if we create a component “ng g c component/dashboard”. This will create 4 files for me in the “src/app/component” folder . These files are
5. dashboard.component.html
6. dashboard.component.spec.ts
7. dashboard.component.ts
8. dashboard..component.css
   and then it will also add the component in app.module.ts in @NgModule({
   declarations: [
   DashboardComponent
   ]
   })
9. If you want to create a service in angular we use "ng g s service/crud". it will create a service files for us in "src/app/service/crud.service.spec.ts" and "src/app/service/crud.service.ts"
10. If we want to create a class in angular we use "ng g class model/Task". it will create a class files for us in "src/app/model/task.spec.ts" and "src/app/model/task.ts"
11. to add component in html file we use <app-nameofcomponent></app-nameofcomponent>. For example if the name of the component is dashboard.component.html then to use this component in another file we use <app-dashboard></app-dashboard>
12. Angular comes with all the paceges you need to build a complete application. All you need to do is to import them in the app.module.ts in the import arrays. for example I want to make use of forms and http. this is how I will import it.
    import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
    import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
13. if we want to get an input from a form we use to "[(ngModel)]" to bind it to a variable or object in the component.ts file

imports: [
BrowserModule,
AppRoutingModule,
FormsModule,
HttpClientModule
],
